## How To Section

this trainer includes several cheats that are explained here:
In the top section of the trainer you will see if the game was found by the trainer or not (it will be found only when the game is runing)

**Hack 1 - Life Force Multiplier (Left_Ctrl + L):** this hack get's a number between 1 and 9999 and every time you take a life force in the game it multiply the number of adding minions with that number. so for example when taking a lifeforce in the game you will gain 1 more minion of that color. but if you will use this hack with the value 5 you will gain 5 minions of that lifeforce color every time you take it.

**Hack 2 - Infinite Health (Left_Ctrl + H):** this hack sets your health to 500 (10 bars) and freeze it on that value so you can't die basically.

**Hack 3 - Infinite Mana (Left_Ctrl + M):** this hack sets your mana to 500 (10 bars) and freeze it on that value so you can't be out of mana.

**Hack 4 - Get Gold (Left_Ctrl + G):** this hack sets your gold to the number you enter. maximum number is 2000000000 (2 bil). if no number has been entered than the max number will be used.

**Hack 5 - Max Minion To Summon (Left_Ctrl + Numpad9):** this hack sets your max minions you can summon to the number you entered. be carful not to make it to big since the game wasn't design to be able to have so much minions so you will start to have memory override and the game will eventually crush. number that I found to works pretty solid is aroun 90. also this number not always be the real number it sets to due to different equipe your avater can have that increase it.

**Hack 6 - One Hit Kill (Left_Ctrl + K):** this hack makes everyone to die from 1 hit except you. IMPORTANT! your minions will also be killed by 1 hit and will also kill with 1 hit use it with cation.

**Hack 7 - Damage Multiplier (Left_Ctrl + D):** this hack will multipy the damage everyone receive except you by the number you set it to be. the default multiplier is 2 if no number has entered. please notice here like in one hit hack your minions will also be affected.
